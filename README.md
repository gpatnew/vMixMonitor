# vMixMonitor


This a project to read the vMix api and display an online status and display a countdown clock on a cofidence monitor for the worship team.  

We use vMix for our weekly livestream of worship services. 

Our desire to keep the Pastor and Worship team aware of the status of the Live Stream and give them a countdown clock to the beginning of the service.

Goals are to:

Display realtime status of the Live Stream
Display countdown timer based on a timed video resource within vMix inputs.
Have the solution be portable and extenable.

Requirements:

Instance of vMix running on network.
